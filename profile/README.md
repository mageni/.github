## Licenses, Fair Use and DMCA
You are probably reading this because you want to use the code, but you have questions about its license. Here is some background information to consider from the perspective of U.S. law, but it's mostly the same everywhere. We won't cover jurisdictional differences like moral rights. 

### What's a Copyright?
Copyright is a bundle of statutory <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106">rights</a> created by U.S. Congress.

Copyright protection can subsist in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression. When someone makes code publicly available in any form, including GitHub, that code may be protected by copyright.

Generally, you should use code under licenses which explicitly give you relevant permissions. Ambiguity about what you can do with code can cause unwanted confusion and make open source difficult to use. In order to avoid any kind of ambiguity, on this document Mageni makes clarifications based on the law.

### What's DMCA?
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act—or DMCA—is a US federal copyright law that was introduced in 1998. The DMCA protects the rights of both, copyright holders and the users of the copyrighted material. According to the DMCA "a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under § 512(c)." Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016) and when using the source code of GPL-covered program, the GPL grants you "fair use" rights (See 17 U.S.C. § 107).

> Do I have “fair use” rights in using the source code of a GPL-covered program? Yes, you do. “Fair use” is use that is allowed without any special permission. **Since you don't need the developers' permission for such use, you can do it regardless of what the developers said about it—in the license or elsewhere, whether that license be the GNU GPL or any other free software license.** Source: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLFairUse">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLFairUse</a>

> “fair use is not just excused by the law, it is wholly authorized by the law.” Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016).

> “[A]nyone who . . . makes a fair use of the work is not an infringer of the copyright with respect to such use.” Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 433 (1984).

All the code published by Mageni on GitHub is GPL-covered and/or by any other free software license and is lawfully and rightfully used as "fair use" as authorized by 17 U.S.C. § 107. So feel free to use the code.

### Three rights to consider

Open source projects function best when there is no ambiguity over the rights to the code. Three important rights for an open source license to address are:

- the right to make copies (also known as reproduction),
- the right to modify and adapt (also known as the right to make derivative works),
- the right to distribute the original and modifications.

Mageni provides to you a free and open-source software covered by free software licenses, with no ambiguities over your rights to use the code.

### Fair Use Rights of a GPL-covered Program
When using the source code of GPL-covered program, the **GPL grants you "fair use" rights** (See 17 U.S.C. § 107). 

> Do I have “fair use” rights in using the source code of a GPL-covered program? Yes, you do. “Fair use” is use that is allowed without any special permission. **Since you don't need the developers' permission for such use, you can do it regardless of what the developers said about it—in the license or elsewhere, whether that license be the GNU GPL or any other free software license.**  Source: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLFairUse">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLFairUse</a>

> “fair use is not just excused by the law, it is wholly authorized by the law.” Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016).

> “[A]nyone who . . . makes a fair use of the work is not an infringer of the copyright with respect to such use.” Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 433 (1984).

According to the GPL and the Supreme Court, you can exercise your fair use rights to distributing free software for a fee. Please see the Supreme Court case of <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/18-956_d18f.pdf">Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc</a> and the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#DoesTheGPLAllowMoney">answer of the GPL</a> Google v. Oracle has been hailed as a “huge win for developers and consumers,” not to mention a “win for innovation” more broadly and this case’s holding will “provide breathing room” to software developers employing similar strategies to create their products. (Michael Barclay, Victory for Fair Use: The Supreme Court Reverses the Federal Circuit in Oracle v. Google, ELEC. FRONTIER FOUND. (Apr. 5, 2021))

While restricting the rights of copyright holders, the Court’s approach to Google v. Oracle took an important step to further the constitutional goal of copyright law: to “promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts." (U.S. CONST. art. 1, § 8, cl. 8.) Mageni has completed extensive audits to cerfify that exercises its fair use rights as authorized by 17 U.S.C. § 107

### DMCA Policy

#### Introduction

Mageni uses a very large number of open source projects and we understand that there's always a posibility that a programmer impelmented copyrighted code which is not covered by a free software license. In that case, this policy is intended to implement the procedures described in the Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Section 512 (DMCA) for the reporting of alleged copyright infringement. It is the policy of Mageni to respect the legitimate rights of copyrights owners, their agents and representatives. Mageni respects the legal protections provided by applicable copyright law. 

#### Before sending any notifications

**Please be aware that, according to the law, "a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under § 512(c)."** Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016). On GitHub you will find that Mageni is using only software covered by free software licenses which grant "fair use" rights and Mageni is exercising its fair use rights as authorized by 17 U.S.C. § 107

> Do I have “fair use” rights in using the source code of a GPL-covered program?

> **if a copyright holder ignores or neglects our unequivocal holding that it must consider fair use before sending a takedown notification, it is liable for  damages under § 512(f).** A copyright holder who pays  lip service to the consideration of fair use by claiming it formed a good faith belief when there is evidence to the contrary is still subject to §  512(f) liability. Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016).

One of the most famous cases of fair use is <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/18-956_d18f.pdf">Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc</a>, Mageni is exercising its fair use rights as authorized by 17 U.S.C. § 107 and uses the code of GPL-covered programs in a transformative way.

> “fair use is not just excused by the law, it is wholly authorized by the law.” Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016).

> “[A]nyone who . . . makes a fair use of the work is not an infringer of the copyright with respect to such use.” Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 433 (1984).

Please send the notification under the DMCA of alleged infringement to the above address. The DMCA requires that notices of alleged infringement include specific information. Consult your with your lawyers before submitting or sending an email to the above address. The DMCA requires that you swear to the facts in your copyright complaint under penalty of perjury. **It is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration. (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1621.) so submitting false, fraudulent, and or bad faith information could also result in civil liability — that is, you could get sued and you could be fined or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.** The DMCA also provides a remedy for bad-faith takedowns (See 17 U.S.C.A. § 512), specifically:

Any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under this section

1. that material or activity is infringing, or
2. that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.
