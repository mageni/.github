Mageni is now a research, educational, and non-profit (non-commercial) open-source playground where I, Jonathan Jaquez, conduct empirical security research and create open-source tools to provide them for free. Mageni comes from the Hebrew word (מָגֵן), which means "Shield" and "Defender," and in Japanese comes from the word Mugen (無限), which means Unlimited, Endless, and Limitless.

<h2>Fair Use ⚖️</h2>

According to the DMCA, "a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under § 512(c)." [1], and when using the source code of a GPL-covered program, the GPL grants you "fair use" rights [2] [3]. Therefore, regarding the GPL-covered source code that I'm using in this repository for research, educational, and non-commercial purposes, I concluded that since the GPL grants "fair use" rights [1], I'm lawfully and rightfully exercising my fair use rights as authorized by 17 U.S.C. § 107 and the GPL. At the same time, I uphold and cherish the copyright holders' rights. 

Additionally, "If a copyright holder ignores or neglects our unequivocal holding that it must consider fair use before sending a takedown notification, it is liable for damages under § 512(f)." [3] Submitting false, fraudulent, and/or bad faith information could result in civil liability — that is, you could get sued and you could be fined or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both.
