## Thank you, open source
Mageni uses <a href="https://github.com/mageni/mageni/network/dependencies">thousands of open source projects</a> and we thank them with all our hearts. We hope that providing Mageni as an free, open source software will help other people the same way those softwares have helped us and in doing so Mageni is also in strict compliance with the open source licenses. 

Mageni is an important open source contribution to the upstream projects as it provides a moderm web interface and EDA which was really missing to the open source community.

## Summary
You are probably reading this because you want to use the code, but you have questions about its license and your legal rights. The DMCA is a U.S. federal law and the Copyrights is a bundle of statutory rights created by the U.S. Congress. So here is some background information for you to consider from the perspective of U.S. law.

### What's a Copyright?
Copyright is a bundle of statutory <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106">rights</a> created by U.S. Congress.

Copyright protection can subsist in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression. When someone makes code publicly available in any form, including GitHub, that code may be protected by copyright.

Generally, you should use code under licenses which explicitly give you relevant permissions. Ambiguity about what you can do with code can cause unwanted confusion and make open source difficult to use. In order to avoid any kind of ambiguity, on this document Mageni makes clarifications based on U.S. law.

### What's a Open Source License?
Open source licenses are licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition — in brief, they allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared. To be approved by the Open Source Initiative (also known as the OSI), a license must go through the Open Source Initiative's license review process.

### Four rights to consider

Open source projects function best when there is no ambiguity over the rights to the code. Four important rights for an open source license to address are:

- the right to make copies (also known as reproduction),
- the right to modify and adapt (also known as the right to make derivative works),
- the right to distribute the original and modifications.
- the right to fair use a copyrighted source code

Mageni provides you free and open-source software covered by free software licenses, with no ambiguities over your rights to use the code.

### What's DMCA?
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act—or DMCA—is a US federal copyright law that was introduced in 1998. The DMCA protects the rights of both, copyright holders and the users of the copyrighted material.

### If I copy the code, will you send me a DMCA takedown notification?
No. Mageni can not and will not send you a DMCA takedown notification. 

According to the DMCA "a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under § 512(c)." Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016), and when using the source code of a GPL-covered program, the GPL grants you "fair use" rights (See 17 U.S.C. § 107).

> Do I have “fair use” rights in using the source code of a GPL-covered program? Yes, you do. “Fair use” is use that is allowed without any special permission. **Since you don't need the developers' permission for such use, you can do it regardless of what the developers said about it—in the license or elsewhere, whether that license be the GNU GPL or any other free software license.** Source: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLFairUse">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLFairUse</a>

> “fair use is not just excused by the law, it is wholly authorized by the law.” Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016).

> “[A]nyone who . . . makes a fair use of the work is not an infringer of the copyright with respect to such use.” Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 433 (1984).

All the code published by Mageni on GitHub is GPL-covered and/or by other free software licenses and is lawfully and rightfully used as "fair use" as authorized by 17 U.S.C. § 107. The GPL and the open source licenses extend the same "fair use" rights to you, so feel free to use the code.

### The Supreme Court and Fair Use Rights
<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/18-956_d18f.pdf">Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc</a> is a fair use case that has has been hailed as a “huge win for developers and consumers,” not to mention a “win for innovation” more broadly and this case’s holding will “provide breathing room” to software developers employing similar strategies to create their products. (Michael Barclay, Victory for Fair Use: The Supreme Court Reverses the Federal Circuit in Oracle v. Google, ELEC. FRONTIER FOUND. (Apr. 5, 2021)) While restricting the rights of copyright holders, the Supreme Court’s approach to Google v. Oracle took an important step to further the constitutional goal of copyright law: to “promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts." (U.S. CONST. art. 1, § 8, cl. 8.) 

When using the source code of GPL-covered program, the **GPL grants you "fair use" rights** (See 17 U.S.C. § 107). 

> Do I have “fair use” rights in using the source code of a GPL-covered program? Yes, you do. “Fair use” is use that is allowed without any special permission. Since you don't need the developers' permission for such use, you can do it regardless of what the developers said about it—in the license or elsewhere, **whether that license be the GNU GPL or any other free software license.**  Source: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLFairUse">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLFairUse</a>

> “fair use is not just excused by the law, it is wholly authorized by the law.” Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016).

> “[A]nyone who . . . makes a fair use of the work is not an infringer of the copyright with respect to such use.” Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 433 (1984).

Mageni has completed extensive audits to certify that exercises its fair use rights as authorized by 17 U.S.C. § 107. 

### Code is a form of speech. In the US, constitutional law protects free speech.

> "This court can find no meaningful difference between computer language, particularly high-level languages as defined above, and German or French....Like music and mathematical equations, computer language is just that, language, and it communicates information either to a computer or to those who can read it....For the purposes of First Amendment analysis, this court finds that source code is speech." (Bernstein v DoS)

Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction. The right to freedom of expression has been recognised as a human right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international human rights law by the United Nations. U.S. constitutional law protects free speech. You are free to use the code provided by Mageni and exercise your right to freedom of speech.

### DMCA Policy

#### Introduction

Mageni uses a very large number of open source projects and we understand that there's always a possibility that a programmer from one of those open source projects implemented copyrighted code that is not covered by a free software license or that violates the freedom of speech rights. In that case, this policy is intended to swiftly implement the procedures described in the Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Section 512 (DMCA) for the reporting of alleged copyright infringement and will remove the offeding code from its repository. It is the policy of Mageni to respect the legitimate rights of copyright owners, their agents, and representatives. 

Mageni respects the legal protections provided by applicable copyright law and this also helps Mageni to protect the source code and the rights of the users of the open-source software that Mageni provides. So if you find copyrighted code that is not covered by a free software license, please report that to our designated agent.

#### Before sending any notifications

Please be aware that, according to the law, "a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under § 512(c)." Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016). On GitHub you will find that Mageni is using only software covered by free software licenses which grant "fair use" rights.

> Do I have “fair use” rights in using the source code of a GPL-covered program?
> **Yes, you do. “Fair use” is use that is allowed without any special permission. Since you don't need the developers' permission for such use, you can do 
> it regardless of what the developers said about it—in the license or elsewhere, whether that license be the GNU GPL or any other free software license.**

> **if a copyright holder ignores or neglects our unequivocal holding that it must consider fair use before sending a takedown notification, it is liable for  damages under § 512(f).** A copyright holder who pays  lip service to the consideration of fair use by claiming it formed a good faith belief when there is evidence to the contrary is still subject to §  512(f) liability. Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016).

> “fair use is not just excused by the law, it is wholly authorized by the law.” Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016).

> “[A]nyone who . . . makes a fair use of the work is not an infringer of the copyright with respect to such use.” Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 433 (1984).

The Ninth Circuit held that the Copyright Act "unambiguously contemplates fair use as a use authorized by law," and accordingly, "a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under § 512(c)." The Ninth Circuit based its holding on the language of section 107, which provides that "the fair use of a copyrighted work … is not an infringement of copyright," and on definitions of "authorize" (which is not defined in the Copyright Act) from Black's Law Dictionary, concluding that "because 17 U.S.C. § 107 both 'empowers' and 'formally approves' the use of copyrighted material if the use constitutes fair use, fair use is 'authorized by the law' within the meaning of § 512(c)." In so holding, the Ninth Circuit rejected Universal's argument that fair use is merely an affirmative defense to infringement.

Mageni is lawfully and rightfully exercising its fair use rights as authorized by 17 U.S.C. § 107 and, before sending any notification, you must also consider the fair use rights of the developers of the very large number of open source projects that Mageni uses and the impact, possible repercussions and legal consequences of your notification.

#### Designated Agent

Notification of alleged infringement should be sent to our designated agent. The DMCA requires that notices of alleged infringement include specific information. Please provide the following information:

1. A signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; 
2. A description of the copyrighted work that You claim has been infringed upon;
3. A description of where the material that You claim is infringing is located on the Site; 
4. Your address, telephone number, and e-mail address; 
5. A statement by You that You have a good-faith belief that the disputed use has not been authorized; and
6. A statement by You, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in Your notice is accurate and that You are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf. 

Please send the notification under the DMCA of alleged infringement to this address:

Legal Department<br />
Mageni Security LLC<br />
44 South Broadway, STE 100<br />
White Plains, NY 10601<br />
Email: opensource@mageni.net

Upon receipt of notification of claimed infringement, we will follow the procedures to comply with the DMCA. Consult your with your lawyers before submitting or sending an email to the above address. The DMCA requires that you swear to the facts in your copyright complaint under penalty of perjury. **It is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration. (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1621.) so submitting false, fraudulent, and or bad faith information could also result in civil liability — that is, you could get sued and you could be fined or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.** The DMCA also provides a remedy for bad-faith takedowns (See 17 U.S.C.A. § 512), specifically:

Any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under this section

1. that material or activity is infringing, or
2. that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.

> **if a copyright holder ignores or neglects our unequivocal holding that it must consider fair use before sending a takedown notification, it is liable for  damages under § 512(f).** A copyright holder who pays  lip service to the consideration of fair use by claiming it formed a good faith belief when there is evidence to the contrary is still subject to §  512(f) liability. Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016).

Mageni has completed extensive audits to certify that exercises its fair use rights as authorized by 17 U.S.C. § 107.
