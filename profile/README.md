### Fair Use Rights of a GPL-covered Program
When using the source code of GPL-covered program, the **GPL grants you "fair use" rights** (See 17 U.S.C. § 107). 

> Do I have “fair use” rights in using the source code of a GPL-covered program?
> Yes, you do. “Fair use” is use that is allowed without any special permission. **Since you don't need the developers' permission for such use, you can do 
> it regardless of what the developers said about it—in the license or elsewhere, whether that license be the GNU GPL or any other free software license.**
> Source: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLFairUse">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLFairUse</a>

According to the GPL and the Supreme Court, you can exercise your fair use rights to distributing free software for a fee. Please see the Supreme Court case of <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/18-956_d18f.pdf">Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc</a> and the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#DoesTheGPLAllowMoney">answer of the GPL</a> 

> “fair use is not just excused by the law, it is wholly authorized by the law.” Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016).

> “[A]nyone who . . . makes a fair use of the work is not an infringer of the copyright with respect to such use.” Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 433 (1984).

The 17 U.S.C. § 102 states that the copyright protection cannot be extended to “any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery ....” Mageni is exercising its fair use rights as authorized by 17 U.S.C. § 107 and the source code is covered by the GPL extending to you the GPL "fair use" rights.

**Before sending any notifications please be aware that, according to the law, "a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under § 512(c)."** Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016).  Mageni is using GPL software which grants "fair use" rights not only to Mageni but to all the users of a GPL-covered program.

> Do I have “fair use” rights in using the source code of a GPL-covered program?
> **Yes, you do. “Fair use” is use that is allowed without any special permission. Since you don't need the developers' permission for such use, you can do 
> it regardless of what the developers said about it—in the license or elsewhere, whether that license be the GNU GPL or any other free software license.**

> **if a copyright holder ignores or neglects our unequivocal holding that it must consider fair use before sending a takedown notification, it is liable for  damages under § 512(f).** A copyright holder who pays  lip service to the consideration of fair use by claiming it formed a good faith belief when there is evidence to the contrary is still subject to §  512(f) liability. Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016).

One of the most famous cases of fair use is <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/18-956_d18f.pdf">Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc</a>.
If in Mageni's repositories you find code that is not covered by a free software license which grants "fair use" rights then, please send the notification under the DMCA of alleged infringement to the above address. The DMCA requires that notices of alleged infringement include specific information. Consult your lawyer before submitting or sending an email to the above address. The DMCA requires that you swear to the facts in your copyright complaint under penalty of perjury. **It is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration. (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1621.) so submitting false, fraudulent, and bad faith information could also result in civil liability — that is, you could get sued and you could be fined or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.** The DMCA also provides a remedy for bad-faith takedowns, specifically:

Any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under this section

1. that material or activity is infringing, or
2. that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.

See 17 U.S.C.A. § 512

So please be aware, if you submit false, fraudulent, and bad faith information you could get sued and you could be fined or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
