Please send any notifications under the DMCA of alleged infringement to the above address. The DMCA requires that notices of alleged infringement include specific information and before submitting or sending an email, please consult your lawyer because:

The DMCA requires that you swear to the facts in your copyright complaint under penalty of perjury. It is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration. (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1621.) **Submitting false, fraudulent, and bad faith information could also result in civil liability — that is, you could get sued and you could be fined or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.**

The DMCA also provides a remedy for bad-faith takedowns, specifically:

Any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under this section

1. that material or activity is infringing, or
2. that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.

See 17 U.S.C.A. § 512

### Free, forever free

Mageni does not sells the open source software. This software is, and always will be, free and open source.
