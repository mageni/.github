Universal Music Corp., 815 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016). *‚Äú[A]nyone who . . . makes a fair use of the work is not an infringer of the copyright with respect to such use.‚Äù* Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 433 (1984). See <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/18-956_d18f.pdf">Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc</a>
